# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Clone this repository
First, you will need to clone this **Repository**.
To clone this repository, run the following command 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/phamnhutdanh/fastfood-ingredients-selection.git
```
## Step 2: Install Javascript packages
You will need to **Install Javascript packages**.
To install Javascript packages, run the following command 
```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```
## Step 3: Start your Application
Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.
This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
